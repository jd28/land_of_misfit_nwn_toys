This is a repository of historical NWN projects, archived here for posterity.  Most of this was written between 2010-early 2016.

neverrun_pw* - A webification of my neverrun app.  Made near the start of NWN:EE beta to learn Rails and knock up some ideas for the official server list.  Main points: Repurpose ServerDesc.txt to ServerDesc.md, add google maps style most active times, a servers/random endpoint for StumbleUpon style server discovery.  When shared with community liason of NWN:EE, he did not like the font or some nonsense, so please be aware the font may be quite.

nwnx2_plugins - Some plugins I made.  Resman was a idea repo, tho I did make some contributions to the original (fixing memleak).  Effects, pretty sure that was a collab with niv. Items contains the first public implementation of hidden helmets (Acaos did that first, privately).  Cache was something of a proto-POS in NWNX:EE parlance, by an amateur who'd watched too many cppcon youtube videos.  cpp was scripting nwn with C++.  The others are either self explanatory or have other repositories to explain them.

NWServers - Some Ruby thing, never used it.

wireshark-nwn - Virusman's original version and my port to Wireshark's Lua api.  So long ago, I forget.

There is a fair bit of other stuff of historical stuff I have created by others that might have been lost in time, that I might add here like I think one guy did an AngelScript client side gui library..
